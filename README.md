# we-hate-your-code
We Hate Your Code is a place to dislike open sourced repositories

## Rules
1. At least one concrete reason must be given
2. Any form of personal insults is NOT allowed, all hate reasons must base on the repository or code.
3. Any content that violates the GitHub ToS is NOT allowed.
4. You must use your own GitHub username in the submitter and upvoter field, removing existing names or impersonation is NOT allowed under all circumstances, even when that person gives you the permission.

## Hates counting

The number of hates of a repository is the sum of upvotes in all reasons.

If a repository has arbitrary number of reasons but all of the reasons have 0 upvotes, the repository is considered to have 0 hates.

## Submitting / upvoting hates
